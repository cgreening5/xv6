-----------------

Two system calls clone() and join(). Clone creates a new thread -- basically, a new process that shares an address space with its parent, with an starting point determined by a function pointert passed as a parameter. 'Join' causes a thread to reap its children after the exit. It accetps a pointer to a void pointer as a parameter, and sets the void pointer to the stack of the user process. It their performs this immediately or waits until the children exit if none have already done so. If the thread has no children, it returns -1.

A threading library, with the methods thread_create() and thread_join(), which take advantage of the above syscall. thread_create() allocates space for a stack and submits the stack in the syscall; thread_join() performs the join() syscall described above, and frees the memory returned.

This probably contains memory leaks.
